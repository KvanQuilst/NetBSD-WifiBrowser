\section{General Progress Report}
Progress on the API front again has been slow, but with the minor progress
and the implementation of the passphrase hashing, it has become apparent
how close the API is to v1.0 completion. Moving into the next milestone, 
the implementation of manual configuration will be changed to both simplify
the implementation and to make configuration more expandable (and able to
better accommodate the large amount of available configuration fields). An
unfortunate piece of information discovered about \texttt{wpa\_supplicant}
was that password hashing for WPA-EAP networks is not worth while considering
that the accepted hashing algorithm does not work for passwords longer than
14 characters, requiring them to be stored in plain text as a result. This
can be somewhat circumvented with better file permissions, which will be considered
during the determination of circumventing the necessity of root privileges.\\

\textbf{Accomplishments}
\begin{itemize}
  \item API supports passphrase hashing
  \item API has generalized and improved makefile
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Targets Not Met:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use API without root privileges
\end{itemize}


\section{Git Branch Report}
One additional branch was used to implement the passphrase hashing (branch \texttt{crypto})
in order to prevent compile issues for the others while figuring out the
details of needing extra dependencies and the solution not being trivial.
Beyond this, most work was performed on \texttt{master}.
