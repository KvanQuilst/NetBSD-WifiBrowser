\section{External Interface Requirements}
% List all external systems to which this project will interface.  For example,
% consider a traffic signal control system.  The red-yellow-green and cross-walk
% buttons are a required interface.  The system communicates over an RS-434
% hardware serial link.  

\subsection{User Interfaces}

The CLI and TUI components are required for our user to interact with our API. We 
also hope to implement a more standard GUI component if time permits. 

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}

Hardware interfaces include those in which the operating system is running. Such 
interfaces include the mouse and keyboard of the system. 

\subsection{Software Interfaces}

Software includes the NetBSD operating system. Including components of the system our API is 
required to interact with. Including \texttt{wpa\_supplicant} and \texttt{wpa\_client}. We will 
also require interfaces for the CLI and TUI as well. Network interfaces will also be required. 

\subsection{Communications Interfaces}

Communication between the existing software components that requires our API to function properly. 
Such is the communication between different parts of the system. Communication over Wi-Fi networks 
and the protocols they interact with. As well as those required to interact with the Wi-Fi card, as 
well as other parts of hardware. Including memory and the NetBSD operating system itself.
