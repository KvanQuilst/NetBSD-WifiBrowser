\section{External Interface Requirements}
% List all external systems to which this project will interface.  For example,
% consider a traffic signal control system.  The red-yellow-green and cross-walk
% buttons are a required interface.  The system communicates over an RS-434
% hardware serial link.  

\subsection{User Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A computer running the NetBSD operating system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A Wifi card or dongle attached to the host computer
  \item A Wifi network to connect to
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{wpa\_supplicant} and its included programs
  \item Wifi driver, supporting different wifi protocols
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Wifi protocols for connecting to the wifi network (mostly handled by the driver with details provided by \texttt{wpa\_supplicant})
\end{itemize}
