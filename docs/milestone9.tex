\section{General Progress Report}
On the front of the API, nothing needs to done before the final report.
At this point, the GUI will not be in a usable state by the final report
let alone the presentation.This is okay since this part of the project was 
a "if there's time" part of the scope.On top of this, work on the final 
presentation has begun. CLI is fully functional and can implement the 
commands needed to run the methods in the API. I wrote some stuff on 
targets not met but wasn't aware to implement those until after our 
meeting. Will work on those this week. CLI has the functionality to 
implement the methods in the API and connect with wap_supplicant. 

\textbf{Accomplishments}
\begin{itemize}
  \item CLI has more common commands such as 'connect', 'disconnect', etc. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Targets Not Met:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item CLI should be able to determine the current connection. 
  \item CLI should be able to determine if a network is an EAP network. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{New Expectations:}
Hangten should at the very least be able to connect to simple networks by the
next milestone, if not EAP networks too.
