\section{Vision of the Solution}
% Now that we know what the customer needs, 
% what will the solution look like?

The solution will look like an API to interact with WPA Suplicant and IOCTL and a user interface to interat and use the API to connect to wifi

\subsection{Vision Statement}
% This is the formal vision statement.  
%
% For:         user class
% Who:         statement of need
% The:         title of product
% Is:          statement of solution
% Unlike:      closest alternative solution
% Our Product: differentiation statement  

\textbf{For}: NetBSD users\\
\textbf{Who}: Need to connect to wifi in a timely manner\\
\textbf{The}: NetBSD Wifi Browser\\
\textbf{Is}: A user interface\\
\textbf{Unlike}: Any other solution within NetBSD\\
\textbf{Our Product}: Will streamline the connection to wifi
  
\subsection{Major Features}
% Describe the major features that solve the customer's needs.
The major features that address the customer's needs is the API for handling the communication with wpa\_supplicant and IOCTL, removing the necessity for a user to work through those mediums. To further simplify the process, multiple user interfaces will be provided with varying levels of simplicity to allow a user maximum flexibility with connecting to a wifi network.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
% What does this product depend on?  
% The goal here is to describe, with as much detail as possible, what the envisioned
% solution needs to operate.  

Our product is dependent on the wpa\_supplicatn and IOCTL programs not changing significantly during the development of our product as our API will direclty interface with the existing functionality of both programs. [Need to fill some assumptions maybe]
