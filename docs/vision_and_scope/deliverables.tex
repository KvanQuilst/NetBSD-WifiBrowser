\section{Deliverables}
% The purpose of this section is to formally list the major components that you
% will produce as part of this project. 

The main deliverables for this project will be an API that interacts with WPA supplicant, IOTCL and the interactive interface built 
on the API that allows users to connect to Wi-Fi, without the need for the command line client. We are hoping to use any extra time 
to slowly improve the user interface with the progression of a CLI, then into a TUI, and finally a GUI if time permits. 

\subsection{Software/Hardware}
% List the software components and hardware, if any, that you will deliver as
% part of this project.  

The software that we will be delivering as a part of this project will be a CLI, TUI, and GUI application.

\subsection{Documentation}
% What user documentation will you deliver.

The main user documentation that will come with our deliverables will be man pages to explain how to use the system.

\subsection{Key Presentations}
% You will present your project at the end of 492 and 493.

When we finally get here, we hope to have a detailed presentation of our API.
