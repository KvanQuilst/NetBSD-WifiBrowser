\section{Deliverables}
% The purpose of this section is to formally list the major components that you

The main deliverables for this project will be the API that interacts with WPA Suplicant IOTCL and the interactive interface built on the API that allows users to put in the neccesary information. We are hoping to use any extra time to slowly improve the user interface with the progression of a CLI, then into a TUI, and finally a GUI if time permits.
