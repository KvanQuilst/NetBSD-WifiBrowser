\section{Deliverables}
% The purpose of this section is to formally list the major components that you
% will produce as part of this project. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item API\\
				The API would be the central component of the product produced, serving as the true mediator between the user and communicating with wpa\_supplicant and IOCTL to accomplish the task of connecting to a wifi network. 
	\item Command Line Interface (CLI)\\
				The CLI would allow the user to connect to a wifi network easiliy utilizing the command line and the aforementioned API.
	\item Terminal User Interface (TUI)\\
				The TUI would a curses based interface that would enable a user to connect to wifi more visually, presenting information without the necessity of a series of commands, but rather through automatically presenting the necesasry imformation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}
% What user documentation will you deliver.

The main user documentation that will come with our deliverables will be man pages to explain how to use the system.

\subsection{Key Presentations}
% You will present your project at the end of 492 and 493.

At the end of CSCI 492, ideally we will have an API to present to our peers with a semi-functional CLI to show off its capabilities and features.
By the end of CSCI 493, at minimum we will have a complete CLI and TUI to present, and if development allows, a GUI (themed by one of the popular NetBSD desktop envrionments) to show to final functionality of our API and the success of simplifying the wifi connection process.
