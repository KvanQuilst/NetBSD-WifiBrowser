\section{Business Requirements}
\subsection{Background}
% What is the business context for the project?
% What does the reader need to know about the customer's industry?

In NetBSD, in order to connect to wifi the user must manually connect using WPA Suplicant and IOCTL to determine the wifi information.

\subsection{Business Opportunity}
% What is the customer's need?
% How does this need fit in the industrial context?

The customers need is a steamlined method to connect devices to the wifi, this would be helpful because NetBSD has no available options to do this.

\subsection{Business Objectives and Success Criteria}
% Why does the customer need this product?
% How will the customer know that the product is a success?
%   You must be very specific here.  What experiment can we do to verify success?

The customer needs this product to help minimize time spent and effort connecting to wifi, the customer will know the product is a success if the user is able to effortlessly connect to wifi in less time

\subsection{Customer and Market Needs}
% Connect the objectives and success criteria back to the customer's business.
% That is, why does the industry require the customer to have this solution? 

The industry requires this solution because they are lazy, and want to spend their time else where.

\subsection{Business Risks}
% This is a hazard assessment.  What could go wrong?  How bad would it be if it
% did?  How likely is it?  What steps can we take to protect against the hazard? 

The main failure would be if we did not accomplish the tasks wanted by our customer, this would not affect the community since there is currently no system put in place for this but would not be great for our grade. We think that it is fairly unlikely that we dont not accomplish our given tasks and we will be working as consistently as we can in order to protect against this hazard.
