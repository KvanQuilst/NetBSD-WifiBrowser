\section{Business Context}

\subsection{Stakeholder Profiles}
% This section describes who will benefit from the product both directly and
% indirectly.  Identify stake holders by their roll and describe their needs and
% interactions for that role.

The stakeholders for this project would be our client, the development team, the eventual users, and the future maintainers. 
The current development team in this instance would be us, the eventual users would be anyone that is currently or who will 
use NetBSD in the future, and the future maintainers are the NetBSD development team who will eventually become maintainers 
if the system is passed to them. Those who will benefit from our project include users of NetBSD. 

\subsection{Project Priorities}
% Prioritize the major features identified above based on the relative
% return-on-investment.  

We will consider developers to be our greatest stakeholders, and then customers or investors of our project. However, we see 
very little return on investment for our project. NetBSD is a free open source operating system, so our API will be free for 
the NetBSD community. 

\subsection{Operating Environment}
% Describe how and where the product will be used.  

The product will be used as an interface to easily connect to Wi-Fi when using NetBSD. It will only be used by the NetBSD 
operating system.
