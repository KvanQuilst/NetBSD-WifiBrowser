\section*{Current Project State}
\textbf{API -} The API at this time is functionally feature complete.
The work left to do is to improve the output of the listing functions in
particular to simplify the work of interface implementers, and to make
changes or fix bugs in response to anything that comes up during the CLI
and TUI development this quarter.\\

\textbf{CLI -} The CLI will need to be redeveloped using the new CLI, or the 
previously existing CLI. I'm still not sure what is wrong with the CLI I developed.
If we can use the previously existing CLI, then the CLI portion is already completed. 
Otherwise, I will need to implement the commands from the API in the new CLI. \\

\textbf{TLI -} The TUI has the design layout and skeleton completely complete, 
the main focus for the upcoming Milestone is to start implementing the connection 
with the API and implement the new naming constructs. Once the implementation 
is complete testing will begin from there. \\

\section*{Quarter Tasks}

\textit{Tasks will be stricken when they are completed like so:} \sout{Task}

\subsection*{API}
\textbf{Milestone 7} April 20
\begin{itemize}

  \item Move testing program out of \texttt{src/} and into \texttt{test/}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Milestone 8-9} May 18
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fix bugs related to CLI and TUI work
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{CLI}

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Milestone 8} May 4
\begin{itemize}
  \item
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Milestone 6} May 18
\begin{itemize}
  \item
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{TUI}
\textbf{Milestone 7} April 20
\begin{itemize}
  \item Have API implementation at least 50% developed
  \item Have a TUI that works and is able to be interacted with 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Milestone 8} May 4
\begin{itemize}
  \item Have API fully implementet
  \item TUI is working completley besides bugs
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Milestone 6} May 18
\begin{itemize}
  \item Go through testing proccess to remove all bugs from TUI
\end{itemize}

\section*{Testing Plan}

\subsection*{API Testing}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ensure list output modifications has not affected previous 
    successful test results
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{CLI Testing}
\begin{itemize}
  \item User commands are processed correctly
  \item Print list of available networks to stdout
  \item Print list of configured networks to stdout
  \item Connect to network of provided ssid (unsecured)
  \item Connect to secured network of provided ssid:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Prompt for passkey
    \end{itemize}

  \item Connect to secured network of provided ssid and passkey
  \item Connect to EAP network of provided ssid:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Prompt for username
      \item Prompt for password
    \end{itemize}

  \item Connect to manually configured network
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Prompt for ssid
      \item Create a new network configuration using ssid; select as current configuration
      \item Commands to add information to configuration
    \end{itemize}

  \item Edit a configured network
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Prompt for ssid
      \item Focus network configuration of the specified ssid
      \item Commands to edit/add information to the configuration
    \end{itemize}
  \item Change default configuration file
  \item Use specified configuration file
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{TUI Testing}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Display list of available networks
  \item Display list of configured networks
  \item when selecting a specific network, show networks details (if any availabl)
  \item Connect to network, secure or not. (Prompt for passkey is secure network)
  \item Able to connect to manually configured networks
\end{itemize}

\section*{Done this Milestone}

\textbf{Kevin:} 2 hours 30 minutes
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finalized design layout Plan
  \item Finalized skeleton setup
  \item Brainstorm new naming ideas for TUI
  \item Team meeting and client meeting
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dylan:} 4 hours 45 minutes
\begin{itemize}
  \item Improved API list output $\rightarrow$ could still use more improvement
  \item Created man page documentation for the API

  \item Turned \texttt{Surf} into a \textit{real} library (a \texttt{.a} file)
  \item Initialized and ensured the completion of Milestone 6
  \item Managed customer contact and meeting scheduling
  \item Team meeting and client meeting
\end{itemize}
